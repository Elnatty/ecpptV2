Constants are similar to variables
- Not true Objects.
- Point to Objects.

Constants are different than variables
- A constant is constant.
- Constants are defined using a Capital Leter.

Example 1:
TEST = 1 # this is a constant variable.
Test = 2 # this is a constant variable.
TEST = 10 # can be reinitialized but it throws an error, same with Test.
